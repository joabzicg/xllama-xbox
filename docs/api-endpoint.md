# LAN HTTP endpoint (OpenAI-compatible)

**Status:** v1 — spike + non-streaming chat + UI parity surface (#118: preferences,
training status, images). Opt-in, **default OFF**. Dev Mode / LAN research only.
Not for the Store, not for public inbound.

xllama can expose its inference core (`xllama::Session`) as an HTTP endpoint on the local
network, so a PC on the same LAN can run inference on the console:
`http://<ip-xbox>:<port>/v1/chat/completions`. It is another front-end on the
same `xllama::Session` abstraction used by the chat UI, bench and CLI. Since
PR #161/#164 the Session lives in `xllama::session_hub()` — ONE process-wide
resident model **shared with the chat UI** ("never 2× model in RAM" holds
process-wide). Code lives in
`uwp/api-server.{h,cpp}` (WinRT `StreamSocketListener`), entirely under `#ifdef
XLLAMA_UWP`; the Linux/CLI build is unaffected.

## Enabling and controlling it

The normal path is **Settings → LAN API**: choose a port and toggle the endpoint
on or off. The listener starts, stops, or rebinds immediately without an app
restart, and the dialog shows its current state.

For operator automation, `api.flag` and `api-port.txt` in `LocalState` remain the
persistent contract. `api.flag` is not consumed: `App::OnLaunched` applies it,
and the Settings toggle writes or removes it. The listener coexists with the
live XAML chat UI.

- **Port:** `LocalState\api-port.txt` if present, else **11434** (Ollama's default port).
  Xbox silently drops traffic for ports in **[57344, 65535]** and reserves **11443** for the
  Device Portal, so the server only honors an override in the bindable app range
  **[1025, 49151]** (and not 11443); anything else falls back to 11434 with a log line.
- **Model:** taken from the request's `"model"` field; if absent, falls back to
  `LocalState\model.txt`. The resident Session may already exist before any
  request — the GUI pre-loads it when a model becomes Ready — and it is
  swapped when a request names a different model. A swap invalidates the
  GUI's KV-reuse state (`hub.generation`): its next turn silently falls back
  to a full prefill.

**Foreground only.** The endpoint dies when the app leaves the foreground (UWP Process
Lifetime Management — no always-on system service). On Xbox this is stricter than on PC: if
the package is game-classified (Device Portal _"Treat UWP apps as games by default"_) it is
**suspended and terminated** in the background, and `ExtendedExecutionSession` does not keep
a listener alive. Keep the app foregrounded on the console while using the endpoint. Accepted:
this is Dev Mode research, not a hosted service.

## Protocol (v1)

| Method    | Path                     | Behaviour                                                                                                                                         |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GET`     | `/` or `/health`         | `200 {"status":"ok","service":"xllama"}` — the spike/liveness probe.                                                                              |
| `GET`     | `/v1/models`             | OpenAI model discovery — every servable on-device model; non-standard `"active": true` marks the one currently loaded.                            |
| `GET`     | `/api/tags`              | Ollama model discovery — same list, Ollama shape.                                                                                                 |
| `POST`    | `/v1/chat/completions`   | OpenAI-compatible chat completion, JSON or SSE; ordered image input with mtmd.                                                                    |
| `POST`    | `/v1/preferences`        | Append a preference sample (`label` + `messages[]`) to `training/samples.jsonl` — same contract as the UI rate op (#118).                         |

| `POST`    | `/v1/images/generations` | SD-Turbo image gen (`prompt`, `steps` 1–4, `seed`); returns OpenAI-ish `{data:[{b64_json,path}]}` (#118). Shares the single-slot mutex with chat. |
| `OPTIONS` | _any_                    | CORS preflight (`204` + `Allow-Methods/Headers`) for browser clients.                                                                             |

Discovery semantics: a model is **servable** when its `LocalState\models\<id>`
directory holds a base GGUF (any `*.gguf` except a bare runtime-LoRA
`adapter.gguf`) or an ORT GenAI layout (`genai_config.json` / `model.onnx`) —
predicate `model_dir_files_ready` in `include/xllama/model_provision.h`
(host-tested). Any listed `id` is valid as the request `model`: the hub swaps
the process-wide resident Session when the requested model differs from the
loaded one (first request on a new model pays the load, and the GUI's KV-reuse
state is invalidated — see Model above).

Request body (subset): `model`, `messages[]` (`role` ∈ system/user/assistant, `content`),
optional `max_completion_tokens` / `max_tokens` (default 512; the former wins — `max_tokens`
is the deprecated OpenAI alias), `temperature`, `top_p`, `seed` (reproducibility), and
`stop` (string or array, added to the format's own stops). `messages` must be a JSON array
and contain a trailing user turn, else `400`. When no `system` message is sent, a default
one is injected (small instruct models degrade with an empty system turn). Other unknown
fields (`n`, penalties, `tools`, …) are ignored, not rejected. `messages[]` is mapped to
`ChatFormat::render_prompt(system, history, final_user)` (`include/xllama/chat_prompt.h`);
`chat_format_for(model)` selects the template and stop sequences.

**Context budget.** The prompt is fitted to the session's `n_ctx` with the same
primitive the chat UI uses (`xllama::fit_prompt`, `include/xllama/prompt_budget.h`) and the
model's own tokenizer: the **oldest** `messages[]` entries are dropped until the prompt plus
the requested reply (`max(max_tokens, 250)` tokens) fits. Dropped entries are logged, not
signalled in the response. When the trailing user message alone cannot fit, the request is
refused with `400` and a body naming the three numbers — a client's oversized input is a
client error, and it used to surface as a `500` from the generator instead.

Only `Content-Length` framing is supported — a `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` request gets
`411` (OpenAI SDKs send Content-Length). Malformed JSON / wrong-typed fields get `400`, never
a dropped connection.

The reply follows the OpenAI shape: `id` (unique `chatcmpl-…`), `object: chat.completion`,
`created`, `model`, `choices[0]` (`message`, `finish_reason` — `length` only when the token
cap is hit, else `stop`; and `logprobs: null`, omitting which breaks openai-python/LangChain
Pydantic validation), and a `usage` block from `InferenceResult` (`n_p_eval` / `n_eval`).

`stream: true` returns HTTP chunked `text/event-stream`, without `Content-Length`.
The first event announces the assistant role; subsequent deltas contain generated
content, followed by `finish_reason` and `data: [DONE]`. UTF-8 fragments and split
stop sequences are assembled before JSON framing. A bounded producer queue feeds
one persistent WinRT writer; the inference thread performs no socket writes.
Overflow and socket failure abort the stream, and the producer is always joined.

Text continuation requires the same model, settings, system/history prefix,
session generation and KV revision. A GUI turn or state restore invalidates the
API's revision. Failed requests cannot commit a reusable prefix. Requests carrying
images always reset and evaluate their entire ordered prompt; image contexts are
cleared after generation.

### Native image input

Send `content` arrays with `text` and `image_url` parts in **user** messages. The
sequence `text A, image 1, text B, image 2` remains in that order through rendering,
mtmd tokenization and bitmap evaluation. Data URLs must be base64 PNG, JPEG or GIF,
with matching MIME/magic bytes. Remote URLs, WebP (unsupported by this pin's
stb_image decoder), malformed payloads and oversize input return an error; images
are never silently discarded. Limits: 16 MiB compressed per image, 32 MiB total,
48 MiB HTTP body including base64 and JSON. Literal mtmd media markers in an image
request's text are rejected.

```json
{
  "model": "qwen25-vl-3b",
  "stream": true,
  "vision_preset": "fast",
  "max_tokens": 256,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        { "type": "text", "text": "What is in this image?" },
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": { "url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..." }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`vision_preset` accepts `fast` (256�1024 visual tokens) or `detailed` (1024�4096).
These set mtmd's `image_min_tokens`/`image_max_tokens`; there is no manual resize
preset. If omitted, `LocalState\vision-preset.txt` containing `1` selects Detailed,
otherwise Fast. The projector opens for each image request, so preset changes take
effect immediately; projector load time is included in client TTFT. Text-only
requests never open it. A future projector cache must have session-owned lifetime.

Image prompts use the actual mtmd chunk token count for context capacity. They are
rejected when prompt plus requested reply cannot fit; history is never trimmed
independently of its bitmaps. Use the model's catalogue `n_ctx` policy to reserve
space (8192 for initial Detailed experiments; memory suitability needs console
measurement). The default context is 2048 and may reject Detailed or multi-image
requests.

Exactly-once path: `prepare_multimodal` creates/clears the shared llama context;
`mtmd_helper_eval_chunks(..., logits_last=true)` evaluates it once;
`generate_from_prefilled(gp, PrefilledContext)` samples from those logits. Occupied
KV token count and next M-RoPE position are separate values. No prompt re-tokenizing
or second prefill occurs. No second language model or Session is loaded.

Provisioning, build handoff and the Series X measurement checklist are in
[multimodal validation](multimodal-validation.md).

For Open WebUI on the PC, configure its OpenAI-compatible connection URL as
`http://<xbox-ip>:11434/v1`, and select the provisioned model from `/v1/models`.
The PC must be able to reach the Xbox directly, including from its container if
Open WebUI runs in Docker. Use data-URL image uploads. Phones/notebooks connect to
Open WebUI on the PC; the Xbox endpoint stays on the LAN. End-to-end Open WebUI
compatibility still needs this console validation.

### Preferences (`POST /v1/preferences`)

Same validation as the UI **rate** op. Appends one JSONL line to
`LocalState\training\samples.jsonl`.

```bash
curl -s http://<ip-xbox>:11434/v1/preferences \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"label":"like","messages":[
        {"role":"user","content":"hi"},
        {"role":"assistant","content":"hello"}
      ]}'
# → {"ok":true,"label":"like","path":"training/samples.jsonl"}
```

`label` ∈ `like|dislike|correction|implicit`. For `correction`, optional
`preferred_assistant` string. Invalid label or empty messages → `400`.

### Training status (`GET /v1/training/status`)

Read-only snapshot of on-device train progress (headless or in-app):

```bash
curl -s http://<ip-xbox>:11434/v1/training/status
# → {"state":"idle"|"running"|"ok"|"fail","usable_samples":N, ...}
```

Optional fields: `result_done`, `progress` (object from
`training/progress.json`), `result` (parsed
`training/out/personalized/result.json` when present). Does **not** start a
job — use Settings / autopilot `start_train` for that.

### Images (`POST /v1/images/generations`)

In-process SD-Turbo with the same clamps as the Image dialog (`steps` 1–4).
Shares the single-slot mutex with chat → `503` when busy.

```bash
curl -s http://<ip-xbox>:11434/v1/images/generations \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"prompt":"a red sports car on a mountain road","steps":1,"seed":42}'
# → {"created":…,"data":[{"b64_json":"…","path":"diffuse-out.png"}]}
```

Requires `sd-turbo-fp16` provisioned (auto-download on first UI Generate still
applies when the user opens Image; the API does not download the model for you).

## Concurrency

`Session::generate()` is single-slot / non-concurrent. Requests acquire the
process-wide `session_hub().mtx` with `try_lock`: a request arriving while
another request **or a chat-UI turn** is generating gets **HTTP 503**
`{"error":{"message":"busy"}}` — the Ollama single-slot semantics, widened to
the whole process. One exception: while the session **pre-load** is holding
the hub (right after a model becomes Ready), `acquire_hub_or_busy()` waits —
bounded, ≤15 s, only while `hub.preloading` is set — instead of bouncing the
client's very first request. Stopping the endpoint closes the listener only;
the Session is hub-owned and is NOT released (the chat UI may be using it).

## Not in scope / do not do

- No `internetClientServer` / public inbound — `privateNetworkClientServer` (already in the
  manifest) covers LAN only.
- No `llama.cpp/tools/server` or cpp-httplib imported into the MSIX.
- The endpoint is **unauthenticated** — only expose it on a trusted LAN.
- ~~Memory note: the server's `Session` is independent of the UI's…~~ **Done
  (PR #161/#164)**: server and UI share the one `session_hub()` Session behind
  the same mutex — two loaded copies can no longer happen.

## Validation

See `scripts/validate-api.sh` (`spike|chat|prefs|train|all`). Run it **from another host on the LAN**,
not from a client on the console itself — cross-device inbound needs no loopback exemption,
but a same-host localhost client would (`CheckNetIsolation`). Spike gate first (`GET /` → 200
proves the bind survives the Series S firewall/PLM), then chat / prefs / train as needed.
Images are not in `all` (need SD-Turbo on device; use the curl example above). Chat round-trip:

```bash
curl -s http://<ip-xbox>:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"<catalogue-id>","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hi"}]}'
```
